               		School of Informatics has a mission to provide higher education to the students in 5 undergraduate programs i.e. Information Technology program, Software Engineering program, Digital Information program, Communication Arts program, Multimedia Technology & Animation program and 2 graduate programs i.e. M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Management of Technology.  In the year 2018, we plan to add one more undergraduate program in “Medical Informatics”. With the intention to create qualified graduates to serve in the changing society and industries in the near future, we will concentrate on establishing teamwork, communication skill, information technology skill and specific skill in the areas that the student choose, so that when graduated the student will be ready to cope to be the future job market. In order to do that, besides regular teaching and lab routines, the students will have to a chance to participate in many activities provided by the school such as listen to the famous guest speakers, participating in the symposium, exhibition, cooperative educations, and industry site visit and etc. With all these activities, students in the school of Informatics will gain more knowledge and experience from both inside the university and outside world, which will open up their vision and creative thinking.
